# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

This is an analysis of a car rides company/mobile application PyBer's performance between the months of January and May of the year 2019. In this analysis we are looking into the application's total number of rides, drivers, the total amount of fares, the average amount of payment per each ride and total weekly fares for each city type, including urban, suburban and rural cities. This analysis also includes a chart that summarizes each type of city's totals and averages and a line graphic that depics the weekly total fares for urban, suburban and rual cities. The said analysis aims to provide the PyBer application leadership with summaries of how this data is different depending on the city type. The analysis is followed by some additional recommendations for the application company to look into further analysis of the influencing indicators with the hope that the leadership can use them for the betterment of their service.

 - [x] This analysis is pulling from the ![city_data.csv](https://github.com/TamaraGR/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and ![ride_data.csv](https://github.com/TamaraGR/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv) files. 

## Analysis

## Recommendations Summary 

Some of analysis additional recommendations include the following:

- [x] Look at gathering information regarding rides statistics by average length of each ride in terms of time and distance. 
- [x] Look at some of the better performing cities among each city category and try to understand why those cities perform better. 
- [x] Look at ride dencity/price/distance/time spent on a ride during regular and peak times, weekdays versus weekends.
- [x] Look at customer demographics, incluidng gender, age, ethnicity to see if that has anything to do with the performance. 
- [x] Look into public transportation services frequency for each city type, including places with exceptionally good and bad public transportation service, see how that data affects PyBer's riding statistics.
